# Earthquake Event Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of earthquake events using Python. The project focuses on identifying trends, highlighting the most active locations, and visualizing the proportional contributions of events from key locations.

---

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are:
1. To identify the top 5 locations with the most recorded events.
2. To visualize the proportional contribution of these locations to the overall earthquake activity.
3. To analyze the frequency of earthquake events over time.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: 
  - A bar chart identifying the top 5 most active earthquake locations.
